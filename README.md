## Overview:

This repo contains the code to do the following:

1. Create one new, shuffled deck of cards (reference https://deckofcardsapi.com/
   for api instructions).
2. Using the deck_id obtained from step 1, draw 5 cards from the deck and display
   their images on the web page.
3. Programmatically discard any number of cards (up to 5) from your “hand”.
4. Repeat step 3 until you have a full house (i.e. 3 of one type of card and 2 of
   another. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands#Full_house for
   more information on what constitutes a full house).
5. Once you have a full house, stop drawing cards and highlight the card images
   that belong to the full house using any kind of css styling you like
